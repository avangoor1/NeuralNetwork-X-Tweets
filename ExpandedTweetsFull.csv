"@Highway_30 Bro, you are asking tech companies to water down our hiring standards to ensure employability for unqualified people based on identity politics. Only RINOS support DEI.

We need to combat h-1b program abuse, support local talent, raise salary thresholds, and enhance oversight for #americafirst. Let's focus on meritocracy!"
"@NotTodayGlowies @elonmusk @RobertMSterling Bro, you already lost. Trump and Elon are both putting #AmericaFirst by hiring the best and brightest. Stop asking for watered down hiring standards to ensure employability for unqualified people based on identity politics. You clearly support DEI, RINO"
