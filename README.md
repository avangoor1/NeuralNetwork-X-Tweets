Now that you have collected tweets, let us explore the steps to train a neural network. 

Step 0: Set up a virtual environment. This ensures that all required libraries and their specific versions are installed in an isolated space, preventing conflicts with other projects on your system. You can use this command in the terminal to create the virtual environemnt: "python3 -m venv venv" and then activate it using "source venv/bin/activate".

Step 1: There is a file called "requirements.txt". This has all the libraries and thier specific versions you need to succesfully run the files in the repository. You can use this command to download the libraries: pip install -r requirements.txt.

Now, your system is ready to train a neural network. However, depending on the power of your machine, it may take a long time for the training process to be completed. You can also explore other options like using Google Colab for training purposes.

Step 2: Train your neural network by running the crossFoldValidation.py program. When I went through the process of training the neural network, I split my collected tweets into five folds of training and testing sets. You can explore them in the folder titled "Cross Fold Validation Sets". Edit the program to add the folder that contains your training and testing sets. When you run the program, it will automatically store the generated model files along with its accuracy.

Step 3: Now, you have a model created. You can now use this model to look at groups of communities online and 
see where in the spectrum of luck and meritocracy they fall by analyzing the results of neural network when 
tested against those tweets.

Step 4: Once you have collected tweets from the specific group you want to test your model on, the best results in terms of correct classification was provided when the test set tweets were expanded. To expand your tweets, you can use the OpenAPI.py program and pass through each tweet you want to expand.
